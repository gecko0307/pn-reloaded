PN2 Build Instructions:

Requirements:
=============

PN2 can be built using Microsoft Visual C++ 7, 7.1 or 8.

For PN2 to work correctly, check that these are satisfied:

WTL:
====

PN2 uses the Windows Template Library, make sure you have this!
If you don't know what it is, or don't have it, see:

Boost:
======

PN2 requires that you have boost installed and configured in your VC include 
directories, the version currently used is Boost 1.33.1.

To build Boost Python (for the pypn extension if you want it) you should 
use the following command line from the root of the boost install:

>bjam -sTOOLS=vc-7_1 --with-python --with-python-root=C:\Python24 --with-python-version=2.4 stage

This assumes that your python 2.4 is installed in C:\Python24.

Good Luck!
